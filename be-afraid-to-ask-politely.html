                <p>LGBT+ do understand that the correct LGBT+ terms is an ever changing minefield.</p>
                <p>Sometimes we might appear prickly when you use the wrong term, or make an badly thought out joke.</p>
                <p>However, despite the sensitive nature of LGBT+ terminoligy, we'd much rather you asked politely when unsure what phrase or word to use than get it wrong!</p>
                <p>If you're unsure, simple quietly say something like "Sorry, but is the word 'Queer' okay for me to use?" or "Hey, how <i>do</i> you pronounce 'Zie'?"</p>
                <p>You'll get much more appreciation for asking, than getting it wrong or awkwardly avoiding the word or phrase!</p>
